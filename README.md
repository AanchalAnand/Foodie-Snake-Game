# Foodie-Snake-Game
This foodie snake game will bring back childhood memories. The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on plane, picking up food, trying to avoid hitting its own tail. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.
